A scalable and secure campus network with VLAN segmentation, dynamic routing (RIPv2), and DHCP.

Network Topology (Replace with an actual screenshot of your network)

📌 Project Overview
This project simulates a university campus network with:

Main Campus (3 Buildings)

Building A: Admin, HR, Finance, Business

Building B: Faculty of Engineering & Computing, Faculty of Art & Design

Building C: Student Lab, IT Department

Branch Campus: Faculty of Health & Sciences

Cloud-hosted Email Server (External connectivity)

🔧 Key Features
✔ VLAN Segmentation – Each department/faculty on a separate subnet.

✔ Dynamic Routing (RIPv2) – For internal routing between routers.

✔ Static Routing – Used for external server access (Email Server).

✔ Router-Based DHCP – Automatic IP assignment for end devices.

✔ Switch Security – VLAN trunking, port security, and best practices.
